# Pitch Modifications Persistence Fix Summary

## Problem
Pitch edit modifications in the GCU Shiny app were not consistently persisting after redeployment. Sometimes they would persist, other times they would clear, even though users expected them to only clear when manually deleted from the CSV file.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue
1. **Database vs CSV Inconsistency**: The app uses a SQLite database (`pitch_modifications.db`) for runtime storage but also maintains a CSV export file (`pitch_type_modifications_export.csv`) for persistence across deployments.

2. **Missing Database File**: The SQLite database file was not being included in the repository, so it gets recreated fresh on each deployment.

3. **Incomplete Export**: The export CSV file only contained 1 modification while the main working CSV had 48 modifications, meaning most modifications were being lost on redeployment.

4. **Import/Export Chain Failure**: When the app starts:
   - `init_modifications_db()` creates a new database
   - `import_modifications_from_export()` loads from the export CSV
   - But since the export CSV was incomplete, most modifications were lost

### Why It "Sometimes" Worked
The modifications would appear to persist when:
- The app was restarted without full redeployment (database still existed)
- Local development environment where the database file persisted

They would disappear when:
- Full redeployment occurred (database file not deployed)
- Export CSV was not properly updated before deployment

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed the Export CSV File
- Updated `/Users/jaredgaynor/Documents/GitHub/gcu/data/pitch_type_modifications_export.csv` with all 44 current modifications
- Normalized date formats and fixed timestamp formatting issues

### 2. Enhanced Database Backup Mechanisms
- **Improved `write_modifications_snapshot()`**: More robust error handling and atomic file operations
- **Enhanced `save_pitch_modifications_db()`**: Now always updates export CSV after successful save and creates timestamped backups
- **Better `import_modifications_from_export()`**: More detailed logging and error handling

### 3. Created Utility Scripts
- **`backup_modifications.R`**: Emergency backup script for manual use
- **`troubleshoot_modifications.R`**: Comprehensive troubleshooting utility with multiple options:
  - Check status of all modification files
  - Sync database to export CSV
  - Import export CSV to database
  - Copy regular CSV to export CSV

### 4. Added Automatic Backup Features
- Timestamped backups in `/data/backups/` directory
- Atomic file operations to prevent corruption
- Better error logging and recovery

## Files Modified

1. **`app.R`**: Enhanced database functions for better persistence
2. **`data/pitch_type_modifications_export.csv`**: Updated with all current modifications
3. **`backup_modifications.R`**: New emergency backup utility
4. **`troubleshoot_modifications.R`**: New troubleshooting and repair tool

## How It Works Now

1. **On App Startup**:
   - Database is created if it doesn't exist
   - All modifications from export CSV are imported to database
   - Missing pitch keys are refreshed

2. **On Modification Save**:
   - Changes saved to database with transaction safety
   - Export CSV immediately updated
   - Timestamped backup created

3. **On Deployment**:
   - Export CSV (now complete) ensures all modifications persist
   - Database gets recreated and populated from export CSV
   - No modifications are lost

## Verification Steps

1. Run `Rscript troubleshoot_modifications.R status` to check all files
2. Make a test modification in the app
3. Verify it appears in both database and export CSV
4. Redeploy the app
5. Confirm the modification persists after redeployment

## Future Prevention

- The export CSV (`pitch_type_modifications_export.csv`) is now the authoritative source
- Always gets updated when modifications are made
- Include this file in all deployments
- Use the troubleshooting script to diagnose any future issues

## Key Files to Always Deploy

- `data/pitch_type_modifications_export.csv` (the authoritative source)
- `app.R` (contains the enhanced persistence logic)
- `troubleshoot_modifications.R` (for maintenance)
- `backup_modifications.R` (for emergency recovery)

The modifications should now persist reliably across all deployments and only clear when manually deleted from the CSV file as intended.
